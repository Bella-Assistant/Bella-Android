## Creating your Bella
All developers are welcome to use the source code to create derivate applications. There are several things I require from all developers for the moment.

1. Please do not use the name Bella for your app.
2. Kindly do not use the standard logo as your app's logo.
3. Please remember to read and follow the [GPL v3 license](https://github.com/ujwalp15/Bella/blob/test/LICENSE). Your derivate work must include this license.
